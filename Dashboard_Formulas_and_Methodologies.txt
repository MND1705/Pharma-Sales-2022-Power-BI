## Detailed Formulas and Methodologies for Power BI Dashboard

### 1. Key Formulas

#### a) Total Sales
```DAX
Total Sales = SUM(Sales[Sales_Price_Total])
```
**Explanation:** Sums up the total revenue from the column `Sales_Price_Total` in the `Sales` table.

#### b) Average Sales per Customer
```DAX
Average Sales per Customer = [Total Sales] / DISTINCTCOUNT(Customers[Customer_ID])
```
**Explanation:** Divides total sales by the unique number of customers (`DISTINCTCOUNT`). This formula accounts for only unique customers.

#### c) Gross Profit
```DAX
Gross Profit = SUM(Sales[Sales_Price_Total]) - SUM(Sales[Cost_Price])
```
**Explanation:** Calculates profit as the difference between total sales and total cost.

#### d) Profitability (%)
```DAX
Profitability (%) = DIVIDE([Gross Profit], [Total Sales], 0) * 100
```
**Explanation:** Divides gross profit by total sales and converts it to a percentage. Uses `DIVIDE` to avoid division errors.

#### e) Retained Customers (Count)
```DAX
Retained Customers = CALCULATE(COUNT(Customers[Customer_ID]), FILTER(Customers, Customers[Status] = "Retained"))
```
**Explanation:** Counts the number of customers whose status is marked as "Retained."

#### f) Churn Rate (%)
```DAX
Churn Rate (%) = DIVIDE([Lost Customers], [Total Customers]) * 100
```
**Explanation:** Calculates the percentage of lost customers relative to the total number of customers.

#### g) Sales by Region
```DAX
Sales by Region = SUMX(FILTER(Sales, Sales[Region] = "Region_Name"), Sales[Sales_Price_Total])
```
**Explanation:** Calculates total sales for a specific region using `FILTER`.

#### h) Contribution by Product (%)
```DAX
Product Contribution (%) = DIVIDE([Sales by Product], [Total Sales]) * 100
```
**Explanation:** Shows the percentage contribution of each product to the total sales.

#### i) Total Customers (Dynamic)
```DAX
Total Customers = COUNTROWS(SUMMARIZE(Customers, Customers[Customer_ID]))
```
**Explanation:** Counts the number of unique customers dynamically.

#### j) Cumulative Sales (YTD)
```DAX
Cumulative Sales = CALCULATE([Total Sales], DATESYTD(Sales[Date]))
```
**Explanation:** Calculates year-to-date cumulative sales using `DATESYTD`.

### 2. Methodologies Used

#### a) Aggregation Techniques
- **SUM and AVERAGE:** Used for basic aggregation of numerical values (e.g., sales, costs, profits).
- **DISTINCTCOUNT:** Ensures unique customer or product counts for accurate metrics.

#### b) Customer Retention Analysis
- **Status Filter:** Used to segment retained, lost, and new customers.
- **Dynamic Filters:** Drill-through and slicers enabled dynamic exploration of customer behavior.

#### c) Regional and Product Analysis
- **Slicers for Regions and Products:** Allowed filtering of sales and profitability data by specific regions or product categories.
- **Sankey Diagrams:** Visualized the flow of sales contributions by regions and categories.

#### d) Profitability Metrics
- **Derived Columns:** Created additional calculated columns for gross profit and profitability percentage in Power BI.
- **Dynamic Comparison:** Used drill-through to compare profitability across customer categories and regions.
